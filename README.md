My submission for the weather app.  While late, the submission was much easier due to all I learned from Project 1.
I believe I was able to hit all the points required in the challenge.  It is unfortunate so many cites have similar names, like the one of the previous cities I lived in was Oakland, CA but when typed in it brings up Oakland Michigan.
